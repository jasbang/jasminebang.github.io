    <div id="sidebar"><h1>About</h1><p>We are dedicated to increasing the visibility of and accessibility to genre fiction that features characters Queer/Questioning, Undecided, Intersex, Lesbian, Transgender, Bisexual, Asexual/Aromantic, Gay/Genderqueer, and beyond (QUILTBAG+) who are of historically oppressed and underrepresented genders, ethnicities, races, religions, disabilities, and cultures. Essentially, intersectional genre fiction with a focus on QUILTBAG+ characters.</p><p>
We believe that in order to reconstruct the world, we must produce diverse genre fiction that never reduces characters down to their identity alone because people are more than labels. We believe that fiction should subvert power structures, empowering the disenfranchised, rather than exploit the oppressed. We believe that fiction should not only entertain, but provoke.
